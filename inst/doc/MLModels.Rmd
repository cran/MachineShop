## Model Constructor Components


### Constructor Arguments

- Parameters without defaults are required and will trigger an error message if not supplied values when called.

- Ideally, the constructor should produce a valid model if called without any arguments; i.e., not have any required arguments.

- The source package defaults will be used for parameters with `NULL` values.

- Model formula, data, and weights are separate from model parameters and should not be included among the constructor arguments.


### name Slot

- Use the same name as the constructor.


### packages Slot

- Include all packages whose functions are called directly from within the constructor.

- Use :: or ::: to reference source package functions.


### types Slot

- Include all response variable types (`"factor"`, `"numeric"`, `"ordered"`, and/or `"Surv"`) that can be analyzed with the model.


### params Slot

- List of parameter values set by the constructor, typically obtained with `params(environment())` if all arguments are to be passed to the source package fit function as supplied.  Additional steps may be needed to pass the constructor arguments to the source package in a different format; e.g., when some model parameters must be passed in a control structure, as in C50Model and CForestModel.


### nvars Function

- Should have a single `data` argument that represents a model frame and return its number of analytic predictor variables.


### fit Function

- The first three arguments should be `formula`, `data`, and `weights` followed by a three dot ellipsis.

- Set `environment(formula) <- environment()` if the formula will be passed to the source package fit function.  Some fit functions expect the formula to be defined in the same environment as the data and weights belong; i.e., the fit formula environment.

- If weights are not supported, the following should be included in the function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if(!all(weights == 1)) warning("weights are unsupported and will be ignored")
```

- Only add elements to the resulting fit object if they are needed and will be used in the `predict`, `response`, or `varimp` functions.

- Return the fit object.


### predict Function

- The arguments are a model fit `object`, `newdata` frame, optionally `time` for prediction at survival time points, and an ellipsis.

- The predict function should return a vector or matrix of probabilities for 2-level factors, a matrix for factors with more than 2 levels, a vector or matrix of expected responses if numeric, a matrix of survival probabilities if follow-up times are supplied, or a vector of survival risks if no follow-up times.


### varimp Function

- Should have a single model fit `object` argument followed by an ellipsis.

- Variable importance results should generally be returned as a vector with elements named after the corresponding predictor variables.  The package will take care of conversions to a data frame and VarImp object.  If there is more than one set of relevant variable importance measures, they can be returned as a matrix or data frame with predictor variable names as the row names.


## Documenting an MLModel


### Model Parameters

- Include the first sentences from the source package.

- Start sentences with the parameter value type (logical, numeric, character, etc.).

- Start sentences with lowercase.

- Omit indefinite articles (a, an, etc.) from the starting sentences.


### Details Section

- Include response types (factor, numeric, ordered, and/or Surv).

- Include the following sentence:
  
> Default values for the \code{NULL} arguments and further model details can be
> found in the source link below.


### Return (Value) Section

- Include the following sentence:

> MLModel class object.


### See Also Section

- Include a link to the source package function and the other method functions shown below.

```
\code{\link[<source package>]{<fit function>}}, \code{\link{fit}},
\code{\link{resample}}, \code{\link{tune}}
```

## Package Extensions

- For full compatibility with the `MachineShop` package, model constructors must belong to its namespace.

- This can be accomplished by rebuilding the package with source code for a new model added; or by defining a new model constructor, say `CustomModel`, and manually adding it to the namespace as follows.

```{r eval = FALSE}
environment(CustomModel) <- asNamespace("MachineShop")
```

- If adding a new model to the package, save its source code in a file whose name begins with "ML_" followed by the model name, and ending with a .R extension; e.g., `"ML_CustomModel.R"`.
